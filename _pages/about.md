My name is Christian.

I’m interested in technology that makes life easier and is esthetically pleasing. I’m a [LaunchBar](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar) nerd. Music is important to me. [I’m a bass player](https://m.soundcloud.com/ptujec/tracks). Podcasts are my favorite medium to learn new things. I love Jesus, my family, nature, sourdough bread, basketball, skateboarding …  

I try to have a positive impact in my local community with [Društvo Steza](http://drustvosteza.si). 

I enjoy sharing. That’s why I set up this site. 

There are some options to get in touch at the bottom of this page.
