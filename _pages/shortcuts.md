I use Shortcuts mostly on iOS. I do my automation mostly in [LaunchBar](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar). But sometimes, even on macOS, a Shortcut is the better solution. 

So here is my (for now small) list of shortcuts: 

### Share Wi-Fi Password
This shortcut retrieves information from your keychain about the current Wi-Fi connection and its password and presents it as a QR code. You will need to enter your username and password in the process.
