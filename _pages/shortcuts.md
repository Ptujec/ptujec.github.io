I do most of my automation in [LaunchBar](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)[^1]. I prefer writing code to clicking it together. But sometimes, a shortcut is just the easiest solutionâ€¦ or the only solution (iOS). 

There are [plenty](https://matthewcassinelli.com/sirishortcuts/) of [great](https://beard.fm/shortcuts) shortcut [resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/) out [there](https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/). I'll share my standalone[^2] shortcuts here.  

### Share Wi-Fi Password

This shortcut retrieves information from your keychain about the current Wi-Fi connection and its password and presents it as a QR code. You will need to enter your username and password in the process.

**[Get Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e2463e2b39d14c5f98a8bb38f8a6746c)** (macOS only)


[^1]: BTW: LaunchBar has [great Shortcut support](https://matthewcassinelli.com/launchbar-adds-improved-shortcuts-support/).

[^2]: I also have some integrated in LaunchBar actions. E.g. in [Set timer](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Set-timer) or [Set alarm](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Set-alarm).
