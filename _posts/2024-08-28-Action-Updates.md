*You can check for new versions of your installed actions and update them with [Action Updates](https://renaghan.com/launchbar/action-updates/) by @prenagha (may take some time) or my [Local Action Updates](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Local-Action-Updates#launchbar-action-local-action-updates) action. (For my actions just [download](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (or clone) my repo, run Local Action Updates and select the repo folder.)*
