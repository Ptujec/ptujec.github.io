I had some fun coding recently. Maybe too much, haha. So here is a list of updates. Some of them are substantial, while others are minor. I also built some new ones.

## New

1) [Add To PodQueue](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/PodQueue#launchbar-action-add-to-podqueue): New action to add video and audio from websites to PodQueue.  
2) [New Text File](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/New-Text-File#launchbar-action-new-text-file-in-current-location): New action to create a text file in the current Finder location.  
3) [Bluesky Search](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Search-Actions#websites): New action to search Bluesky.  
4) [New Spanish and French text-to-speech actions](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/System-Actions#launchbar-system-actions).

## Big Updates

1) [Notification actions](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Notifications#launchbar-actions-for-managing-notifications) are ready for macOS 15.2.  

2) [Raindrop actions](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Raindrop-Actions#launchbar-actions-for-raindropio): No new features, but there are some important bug fixes and improvements. For example, the saving action is detecting duplicates correctly again. Tag suggestions are now consistently showing, even if you haven't used the action in a while.   

3) [Writing Tools](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Writing-Tools#launchbar-action-writing-tools-powered-by-chatgpt) now has an alert to keep you from accidentally using auto select. With this, I also added a setting to disable the alert for certain apps. Plus, you can now choose from all available GPT models. This also applies to the Ask ChatGPT action.

4) [Todoist Inbox](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Todoist-Inbox#launchbar-action-todoist-inbox): I added the option to use quotations to keep input from being parsed as dates or other things besides the title.  

5) [Markdown Link to RTF](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Text-Actions#launchbar-text-actions): Before, this action was only able to convert exactly one markdown formatted link at a time. Now it can handle multiple links and other text around it. It will still only format the links, though. I changed the name, so you won't find it in updates.  

## Other updates

I'll just list those:

- [Recent MindNode Next Documents](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Recent-MindNodeNext-Documents#launchbar-actions-recent-mindnode-next-documents)  
- [NBA Action](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/NBA-Scoreboard#launchbar-action-nba-scoreboard)  
- [Verbs](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Verbs-Action#launchbar-action-verbs)

- [Scratchpad](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Gedankensalat#launchbar-action-gedankensalat-scratchpad)  
- [Calculate with Soulver](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Calculate-Soulver#launchbar-action-calculate-with-soulver) (tiny change)
