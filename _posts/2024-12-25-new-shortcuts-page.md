I did not mean to create a shortcut today, but I did. I prefer writing code to clicking it together, but I just could not find an easier way to create a QR code. I did not feel like installing a third-party command-line tool or using Swift. So here we are. I am not sure how many will follow, but I decided to share this one and even [created a new page for it here](https://ptujec.github.io/shortcuts/).
