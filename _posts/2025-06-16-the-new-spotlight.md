If you're reading this, it should be no surprise that the [Spotlight announcement](https://www.apple.com/si/newsroom/2025/06/macos-tahoe-26-makes-the-mac-more-capable-productive-and-intelligent-than-ever/) at WWDC 2025 caught my attention. I'm a launcher nerd.

I think what Apple did is great. Well, at this point it *looks* great. I need to try it to actually judge it. But it looks promising.

Obviously, people following along with the announcement were talking about apps being sherlocked by this. I get it. But it feels a bit silly to me by now.

[LaunchBar](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-was-the-first-launcher-ap-rqhBERPsRC.YKSVPommVCA), my launcher of choice, has not been replaced by the initial launch of Spotlight, nor by Quicksilver or Alfred or anything that followed. I know firsthand that it won't go anywhere. This is because it is a labor of love. It does not need to justify a ton of VC funding. It does not need my private data. It has a very solid core, is extensible, and has never lost its focus. So I am not worried about LaunchBar one bit.

What caught my attention most is the App Intent integration. Spotlight now is another app besides Shortcuts that is able to do stuff with them.

Is there a chance that Apple opens that [private API](https://mastodon.social/@jgarnham/114508467792973758) at some point?

This is what [I really want](https://hessen.social/@ptujec/114612574020290426). I don't want to be limited to the Shortcuts interface to use App Intents. I want direct access to them. I want to integrate them into LaunchBar actions.

BTW, the last bit of this year's live version of [The Talk Show](https://youtu.be/vqwPUHTFEkg?si=mkFtnEBEyZJq55D7&t=7074) is about the Spotlight announcement. It's worth a listen. (The (non-)reaction to Gruber's LaunchBar was sadly funny, but expected, I guess.)
