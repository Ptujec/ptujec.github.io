It didn't take me long after upgrading to Sequoia to realize that my notification actions didn't work anymore. It would be so nice if there were a better solution than UI scripting… or at least a little less "missing values"…

Enjoy [the update](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Notifications) if you're on Sequoia as well.
