Recently I have realized that I mainly use ChatGPT for checking my spelling and grammar. It works fine with my "[Ask ChatGPT](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Ask-ChatGPT)" action. But the purpose of that action is more conversational. For spellchecking, I just need the edited text, not a dialogue. I also thought I could optimize a few things. So I created a new action called "[Writing Tools](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Writing-Tools#readme)".

It is optimized for text editing. You can send text to it or have it grab all text automatically. The action will apply your default tool and replace the selected text with the edited version. This works particularly well with iA Writer since Writer does a [great job of displaying what has been edited](https://ia.net/writer/support/editor/authorship).
