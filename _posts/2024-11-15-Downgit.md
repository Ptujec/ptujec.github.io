DownGit was a neat solution to download subdirectories of a GitHub repository, so you would not need to download an entire repository if you just want, e.g., a specific LaunchBar action.

This is great until [Google marks the service as unsafe](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/DownGit/issues/62). I have also encountered some issues with large subdirectories before, so today I decided to remove this option.

Currently, the best solution is to just download or [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the whole repository. It is not very large anyway.

Another option would be to sign actions and [publish official releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases). But for me, that would be a lot more work. To be honest, every time I attempted it, I was scared off because it just looked too complicated. I might be wrong, but to me, it seems fair and transparent that you are able to download the very code you can look at on GitHub. For this reason, I also don't compile AppleScripts but have them as plain text in my actions.

Downloading or cloning the whole repository also has an advantage: It makes it easy to stay up to date with my [Local Action Updates](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Local-Action-Updates#launchbar-action-local-action-updates) action.
