Action Updates have been a talking point since Objective Development [introduced LaunchBar Actions with version 6 back in June 2014](https://www.obdev.at/blog/launchbar-6-released/).

Early on, users made efforts to address the lack of a way to update actions, most notably Padraic Renaghan. In my experience, [his update action](https://renaghan.com/launchbar/action-updates/) works well if you only use a few custom actions and if the action developer has provided support for it. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.

I have learned from the fine folks at Objective Development that implementing something like this on their side would have more implications than one might think.

So, I was wondering what I could do about it. My first attempt at a different approach was [Local Action Updates](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Local-Action-Updates#launchbar-action-local-action-updates). But something was missing. I noticed this when I installed new actions for family members. Downloading the entire repo every time seemed unnecessary.

This is how "LaunchBar Repo Updates" came about. **It's the missing link to a simple and fast way to update custom LaunchBar actions that are shared in repositories like mine.**

PS: I have pushed a bunch of updates recently and also added a few new actions, like [Menus](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Menus#launchbar-action-menus), [Scan QR Code](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Scan-QR-Code#launchbar-action-scan-qr-code), and [Actual Budget](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Actual-Budget#readme).

PSS: The most user-friendly thing would probably be a dedicated app in the style of [Latest](https://max.codes/latest/). But for now, I am pretty happy with this combination of actions.
