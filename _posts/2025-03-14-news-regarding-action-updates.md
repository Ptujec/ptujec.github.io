Action Updates have been a talking point since Objective Development introduced LaunchBar Actions with version 6 back in June 2014.

There have been efforts from users to tackle this, e.g., [Padraic's action](https://renaghan.com/launchbar/action-updates/). It works great if you only use a few actions and if the action developer has done the work to support it. That, unfortunately, is not always a given.  

I have learned through my interactions with the fine folks at Objective Development that implementing something like this on their side has more implications than one might think.

So, unfortunately, this is not a spoiler of some grand secret plans. Neither do I have the magic pill to solve this. **But I may have a nice little new action that might come at least closer to it.**

You can read all about it [here](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/LB-Repo-Updates#launchbar-repo-updates-action).

BTW: I have pushed a bunch of updates recently and also added a few new actions like e.g., "[Scan QR Code](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Scan-QR-Code#launchbar-action-scan-qr-code)" or "[Actual Budget](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Actual-Budget#readme)".
