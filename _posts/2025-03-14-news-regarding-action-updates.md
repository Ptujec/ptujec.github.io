Action Updates have been a talking point since Objective Development introduced LaunchBar Actions with version 6 back in June 2014.

Users have made efforts to address this issue, most notably Padraic Renaghan. [His action](https://renaghan.com/launchbar/action-updates/) works well if you only use a few custom actions and if the action developer has provided support for it. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.  

I have learned through my interactions with the fine folks at Objective Development that implementing something like this on their side has more implications than one might think.

So, unfortunately, this is not a spoiler of some grand secret plan. Neither do I have the magic pill to solve this. **Buuuut I may have a new action that might come at least closer to a solution.**

You can read all about it [here](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/LB-Repo-Updates#launchbar-repo-updates-action).

BTW: I have pushed a bunch of updates recently and also added a few new actions like e.g. "[Menus](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Menus#launchbar-action-menus)", "[Scan QR Code](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Scan-QR-Code#launchbar-action-scan-qr-code)" or "[Actual Budget](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Actual-Budget#readme)".
